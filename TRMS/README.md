This is a Tuition Reimbursement Management System. While the SQL and Java aspects of this project are completed, I have yet to create a user interface using HTML, CSS, and other software I am not as experienced in. With that said, this project, like the car project, is an excellent source to see object oriented concepts and data structures of Java in action. To find the Java source code, go to src\main\java\com\p1\stuff. To find the SQL file, go to \target.
